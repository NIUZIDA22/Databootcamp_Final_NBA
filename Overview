This project builds a machine learning pipeline that predicts how many points an NBA player will score in their next game, using real-time data collected from the balldontlie.io API (v2).

A key design decision in this project:

We intentionally use ONLY 3 months of recent games
because performance has strong recency effects —
lineup changes, injuries, usage role, coaching adjustments, and team pace shift quickly.

Training on an entire season actually hurts accuracy,
because old games no longer reflect the player’s current situation.

Therefore:

Data window: 2023-11-01 → 2024-02-01

Teams: All 30 NBA teams

Goal: Maximize predictive accuracy with timely, up-to-date information

Model: XGBoost Regression

Target: next_pts (points in the next game)
